1. Move all existing steps to separate yaml files (google of ask GPT for "composite" action qualifier)
2. Check between both scripts what code is alike (code duplicated)
3. Refactor alike steps to be based on variables and not actual values like inputs.client1_branch - let it be CLIENT1_BRANCH as in default action)
4. Rewrite both jobs to use composite steps and only let them configure variables that impact the step flow
